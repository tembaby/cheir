Next function construct will screw up cheir:

 1. some_function(arg)
 2. {
 3. #if defined (_WINDOWS)
 4. 	if (cond_for_windows) {
 5. #else
 6. 	if (cond_for_unix) {
 7. #endif
 8. 		return (0);
 9. 	}
10.	return (1);
11. }

getfuncs pushes on BRACES stack a new function definition context
at line (2), that is, when popd from the stack (11), we know that
the function difinition has ended.  But braces at (4) and (6)
starts *two* new BRACE context that only get matched by only one
single '}' at line (9).  So '}' (9) will finish context at line
(6), and '}' (11) will finish context at line (4) (error/confusion)
and '{' at line (2) will have undefined/errornous matching '}'.

May fail on complex code, like those who contains a lot of
#ifdef #else #endif directives, code generated by lexers etc.
